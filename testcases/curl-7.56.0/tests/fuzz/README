Fuzz tests
==========

The goal is to add tests for *ALL* protocols supported in libcurl.

Building the fuzz target
========================
From the CURL root directory:

export CC=clang-5.0
export CXX=clang++-5.0
export CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard,trace-cmp"
export CXXFLAGS="-fsanitize=address -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc-guard,trace-cmp -stdlib=libc++"
./configure --disable-shared --enable-debug --enable-maintainer-mode
make -sj

cd tests/fuzz

(optional) export LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE=<path to libFuzzer.a>

make check
